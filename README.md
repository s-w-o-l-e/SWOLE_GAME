# Swole
Swole is our college game project (made by the duo https://github.com/deankevorkian and https://github.com/Gil9). Basically, the main character is a black hole (Swole if you like, hence the name) that (hopefully, if implemented) can eat anything. The more he eats, the larger he gets, [inspired by hole-io](https://hole-io.com/).
We may add multiplayer support, but for now it also fits for a singleplayer.
We will also have NPCs in the shape of enemies patrolling around the map and shooting the black hole with laser guns (inspired by...?). NPCs will probably have the shape of Roblox, or just zombies... We're not sure about anything at the moment.
If you are here reading this, you probably won't download the game anyway. However, if you do, it is fun and addictive ;)

Created and developed using Unity.
